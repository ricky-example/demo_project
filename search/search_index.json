Data Collection Gather data from relevant sources (databases, APIs, files, etc.). Data Cleaning Remove missing values, fix formatting, and handle outliers. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Use plots and statistics to understand patterns and trends. Model Building Train machine learning models using the cleaned data. Evaluation Test how well your model performs using metrics like accuracy or RMSE. Deployment Make the model available for use via APIs or web apps.
